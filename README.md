# CPP Quest

This is a RPG-style console game for people interested in learning C++. I decided to make this game because LeetCode is cool and semi-gamified but I like RPGs. I have a lot to do to make this game useful to anyone but myself. 

## Gameplay
For now, this will only be a console app consisting of interview-style read/write input and output operations

## Graphics
Eventually I would like to include a graphics engine but I want to work out the game play and learning system first.

## Development environment and cross-platform issues
The current version was developed on a Windows 10 machine with visual studio using C++17 and has been tested on Ubuntu 20.

## TODO:
### Game Development:
-use CMAKE build system
-create system for lesson management
-Generate more lesson XMLs based on the sequence of Stroustrup's Tour of C++
-Create sidequest system
-Create storyline
-Add graphics

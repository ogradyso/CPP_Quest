# CPP Quest

This is my first attempt at making an RPG-style C++ Learning Console game. I decided to make this game because LeetCode is cool and semi-gamified but I like RPGs. I have a lot to do to make this game useful to anyone but myself. 

## Gameplay
For now, this will only be a console app consisting of interview-style read/write input and output operations

## Graphics
For now, this will only be a console app consisting of interview-style read/write input and output operations. Future versions will have graphics including characters, maps, icons, and rewards.

## Portability/Compatabilty
The current version was developed on a Windows machine with visual studio. As I learn more I will use conditional compilation to ensure portability to Mac and Linux.

## TODO:
### Game Development:
Create game class - 
  1) GettingToKnowLinux Intro session to get new learners comfortable with Linux/Unix command line; 
Ceate character class - mainCharacter, advisor, ally, civilian, enemy
  1) chooseLearningClass - Hobbyist; ApplicationDev; LibraryDev; NetworkDev; Wizard
  2) choosePlayerClass - Archer, Knight, Mage,\
  3) completing learningClass assignments unlocks playerClass missions, maps, items (armor, weapons, other), spells, and attack/defense techniques
  4) crafting system
Create map class for open world exploration
Create loadGame function to load a previously saved game
Create experience and level system
  1) completing learningClass assignments unlocks playerClass missions, maps, items (armor, weapons, other), spells, and attack/defense techniques
 Create storyline
  1) The story line will probably be a pretty lame mix of the Bleach Anime show with Final Fantasy-like epic boss battles and unwinnable missions.

### Code improvements:
1) Create a generic inputValidation function
